Dear Esterbrook Team,<br>
I hope this email finds you well. My name is 赵连硕 (Zhao Lianshuo), and I am writing to you as an enthusiastic pen collector from China.<br>
I have two inquiries that I hope you can assist me with:<br>

- I am interested in purchasing Esterbrook pens and would like to know if there are any official retailers or authorized dealers in China. This could be either physical stores or online platforms. Your guidance on where I can reliably purchase genuine Esterbrook products in China would be greatly appreciated.
- I recently learned from your website that Charles Schulz, the creator of the beloved Peanuts comics, used Esterbrook pens for his work. As an admirer of both Schulz's art and fine writing instruments, I am very curious about the specific model(s) he used. Could you please provide information on which Esterbrook pen(s) Charles Schulz favored for his artistic creations?

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you and potentially becoming an Esterbrook pen owner in the near future.<br>
Best regards, 赵连硕

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out and for your enthusiasm for Esterbrook! We appreciate your interest in both our pens and the history surrounding our brand.

We have contacted our colleagues in China to gather the names of a few authorized dealers, and we will be sure to inform you as soon as we hear back.

Regarding Charles Schulz, we are incredibly proud of our connection to this talented artist. Schulz preferred our vintage dip-style pen with the Radio nib for his iconic work on the Peanuts comics. Although we no longer produce these specific pens, they can still occasionally be found on auction websites that specialize in vintage pens, especially those from the 1950s. It’s a testament to the enduring quality and craftsmanship that artists like Schulz relied on throughout their careers.

Thank you once again for your interest in Esterbrook, and we look forward to helping you become part of our pen community.

Best regards,

 

Bryan Hulser
