Today, a  student who goes by "Orange Jam" messaged me on QQ, asking if I'd be willing to speak as an "outstanding class monitor" at Thursday's meeting. My first reaction was a mental "Me?!" filled with disbelief.
![我吗](https://pics0.baidu.com/feed/faedab64034f78f0ddc152f44bc29758b1191ceb.jpeg?token=e8c409a2a0aa22934fd164a4ae0161fd)
Throughout my three years as a class monitor, I only bothered showing up at a few "academic atmosphere improvement" meetings during the first year. After that, I mostly coasted by, relying on volunteers to handle things. My only notable achievement was patiently tracking down students who hadn't submitted their assignments last year - a practice I haven't even maintained until now. What qualifications did I have to speak as an exemplary representative?
After spending an entire class period building up my mental fortitude, I finally replied with a simple:

> Okay

Only to receive:

> Sorry Liam, since we didn't get your response earlier, we've found another class monitor

That's when I realized they were just looking for someone - anyone - to fill a speaking slot.
So,

>Okay

By the way,Its OK , Its OK sounds cool and cool.(I don't like hotdog)
